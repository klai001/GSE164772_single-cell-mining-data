# GSE164772_single-cell-mining-data
Here i aim to isolate the microglia clusters of interest from GSE164772 count data and to evaluate cluster specific comparison across Adult and Juvenile datasets




GSE164772 Dataset:
Mpeg+ and CD45+ cells were sorted and sequenced from 28 dpf (Adult) and 6 dpf (Juvenile) zebrafish. Zebrafishes are pooled for each sample, 
but 2 sequencing lanes are used for J
uvenile while 1 lane is used for adult zebrafish group.
